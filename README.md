👨‍💻 Fullstack Developer | Python Enthusiast 🐍 | Based in San Francisco 🌉 | Lover of Clean Code & Coffee ☕️

Hey there! 👋 I'm Carl Johnson, a passionate fullstack developer hailing from the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco. With a deep-seated love for all things Python 🐍, I thrive on crafting elegant solutions to complex problems. Whether it's building robust backend systems or crafting delightful user experiences on the frontend, I'm always up for the challenge!

My journey into the world of coding began with Python, and it remains my language of choice for its simplicity, versatility, and readability. From building scalable web applications with Django and Flask to diving into data science and machine learning projects, Python has been my faithful companion every step of the way.

When I'm not busy crafting code, you can find me exploring the eclectic culinary scene of San Francisco 🍽️, hiking the picturesque trails of the Bay Area 🏞️, or immersing myself in the latest tech podcasts and blogs 🎧.

Let's connect and collaborate on some exciting projects! Drop me a message, and let's bring our ideas to life, one line of Python at a time. 💡🚀
